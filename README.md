# Included Cogs

### Roleplay
This cog was not made by me, I decided to change a few things and remove any broken images along with changing the hosting for them to prevent more breaking in the future. These changes are for my personal use however you are more than welcome to use the cog if you wish. The original cog hasn't been updated in a few years so I figured it would be best to just make my own repo and upload it here so that I can easily update it myself. All credit for the original cog goes to [Jintaku](https://github.com/Jintaku) and their version can be found below.
